/**
 * This package contains the registry and some helper classes for the registry.
 * The registry serves as a static journal for registering available metrics,
 * dimensions, estimation algorithms and approaches as well as configuration
 * parameters. This registry also provides an extension mechanism to reference
 * elements from EMF models. This is done by registering a handler for the
 * LibReDE protocol handler which is called whenever EMF tries to resolve a
 * reference with a corresponding URI.
