When creating a performance model, it is necessary to quantify the amount of resources consumed by an application serving individual requests. In distributed enterprise systems, these resource demands usually cannot be observed directly, their estimation is a major challenge. Different statistical approaches to resource demand estimation based on monitoring data have been proposed, e.g., using linear regression or Kalman filtering techniques.

LibReDE is a library of ready-to-use implementations of state-of-the-art approaches to resource demand estimation that can be used for online and offline analysis. It is the first publicly available tool for this task and aims at supporting performance engineers during performance model construction. The library enables the quick comparison of the estimation accuracy of different approaches in a given context and thus helps to select an optimal one.
